They're in their learning box and the listening staff. They haven't moved. They're not making a lot of noises. They're not fooling around. Look at these guys doing a really good job. So I'm just going to reward them with a nice treat right away. Look at... Aren't these goofy? They're so weird. They're like neon. You're welcome. Isn't that nice that they just said thank you right away? You are welcome. And they're just going to pop them in their mouth. You are welcome. They're not going to worry about it. They're not going to be fussing with them. They're not going to be playing with them. They're just going to pop them in because they were doing such a great job. Now I can be watching for any other team members that could do a good job that I'd be happy to give out a treat to. Good job, girls. Come on in. Sit down. Now see how quietly they came in?

He cut a ribbon in front of the main door. The ribbon was made of paper. After it was cut, people walked through the door for the first time. Hundreds of people were there. All day long, they took part in a big party on a floor 86 stories high. This building holds as many people as there are in some cities. Each building has a building. Today, 25 ,000 office workers will ride one of the 63 elevators. Another 15 ,000 people will visit. They might stop, shop, or get their hair cut. The Empire State Building is a skyscraper. It is so tall that it seems to scrape the sky. At the very top is a tall, pointed tower. People go to the top and look at the view. They can see at least 50 miles away. Okay.

After adding more wood to the fire, Little Willie kissed Grandfather, hitched up searchlights, and started off for town. At the edge of their property, he stopped to sled for a moment and looked back at the farmhouse. He saw the fallen snow. A trail of smoke escaped from the stone chimney. The jagged peaks of the tips and mountains shot up in the background towards the clear blue sky overhead. Yes, sir, he remembered Grandfather saying, there were some things in this world worth dying for. Little Willie loved this country. He loved to hike and to fish and to camp out by a lake. But he did not like to hunt. He loved animals too much to be a hunter. He had killed a bird once with a slingshot, but that had been when he was only six years old, and that had been enough.

But then we got the next crew in there, and they couldn't pay attention because of everybody else. And then we got the next crew in there that got all mad because they can read. I've never seen anybody mad because they can read. But you're going to have to do those on your own half the time. If you just keep your mouth closed and follow what I'm doing, or follow what we're doing, you're going to pick this stuff up. And I'm not going to lie to you and tell you it's fun. It's not fun.

      "Given this data, it seems like the system logs teacher-initiated small-scale activities such as marking tasks complete or updating statuses without any additional text input from either party. The duration indicates these are very quick actions likely occurring at regular intervals throughout an educational session. \n",

Not long after that, the village tinsman came along. What's going on here, he asked, or she asked. The woman and the farmer winked at her and said, This young man is making stone soup. He says it will be fit for a king. The tinsmith said, Soup, soup from a stone? Who ever heard of it? Yes, and it will be fit for a king, said the young man. But it would be even better if I had a carrot to add to the kettle. The tinsmith winked back at the other two and returned with a long, crispy orange carrot.

He cut a ribbon in front of the main door. The ribbon was made of paper. After it was cut, people walked through the door for the first time. Hundreds of people were there. All day long, they took part in a big party on a floor 86 stories high. This building holds as many people as there are in some cities. Each building has a building. Today, 25 ,000 office workers will ride one of the 63 elevators. Another 15 ,000 people will visit. They might stop, shop, or get their hair cut. The Empire State Building is a skyscraper. It is so tall that it seems to scrape the sky. At the very top is a tall, pointed tower. People go to the top and look at the view. They can see at least 50 miles away. Okay.

The jagged peaks of the tips and mountains shot up in the background towards the clear blue sky overhead. Yes, sir, he remembered Grandfather saying, there were some things in this world worth dying for. Little Willie loved this country. He loved to hike and to fish and to camp out by a lake. But he did not like to hunt. He loved animals too much to be a hunter. He had killed a bird once with a slingshot, but that had been when he was only six years old, and that had been enough.
